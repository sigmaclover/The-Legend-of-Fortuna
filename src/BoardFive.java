/* Author: Josiah Etto
 * Description: This JPanel plays level 5. In level 5, it is only boss fight against the Witch. 
 * The Witch can stop time and her projectiles can follow you around. After the Witch takes 15 hits,
 * the player wins the level and the window turns black and displays the words You Win in large text.
 * This class is final because it was not intended for any other class to subclass it.
